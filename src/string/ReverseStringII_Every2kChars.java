  541. Reverse String II
 *  https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/
 *  Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. 
 *  If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. 
 *  If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
 *  
    Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
    Output: "bacdfeg"
    
    Time and Space Complexity: O(N)
