 * 239. Sliding Window Maximum  (hard )
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/
 
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. 
You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 

Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7


Approach: Deque (double-ended queue)

How can I improve the time complexity? The first idea is to use a heap, since in a maximum heap heap[0] is always the largest element. 
Though to add an element in a heap of size k costs log(k), that means O(Nlog(k)) time complexity for the solution.


The algorithm is quite straigthforward :

1. Process the first k elements separately to initiate the deque.

2. Iterate over the array. At each step :

  a. Clean the deque :

        Keep only the indexes of elements from the current sliding window.

        Remove indexes of all elements smaller than the current one, since they will not be the maximum ones.

  b. Append the current element to the deque.

  c. Append deque[0] to the output.

Return the output array.


Time complexity : O(N), since each element is processed exactly twice - it's index added and then removed from the deque.

Space complexity : O(Nâˆ’k+1) is used for an output array and O(k) for a deque.

	 * Deque(pronounce deck) represents a Double Ended Queue, meaning a queue where you can add and remove elements from both ends of the queue
	 
	add() - add elements to the beginning end of a Deque 
	addLast() - adds an element to the end (tail) of a Deque
	addFirst() - add an element at the beginning instead of the end of a Deque 
	
	remove() - removes the first element of a Java Deque
	removeFirst() - removes the first element of a Java Deque
	removeLast() - removes the last element of a Deque
